# RCC Builder – ABAQUS CAE Plugin

RCC Builder is a custom ABAQUS/CAE Python plugin designed to automatically generate Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC) members—including concrete body, longitudinal rebars, and stirrups—with user-defined geometry, spacing, mesh size, and orientation.

This plugin significantly reduces manual modeling time and ensures consistent, parametric RCC modeling, making it ideal for research, teaching, and professional FE simulations.
